## Part 1: WeatherPy

To visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.

2- Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship including Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

## Part 2: VacationPy

1- To import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1. 

2- To use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to create map visualizations.

3 - To use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of the coordinates

4 - Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map
